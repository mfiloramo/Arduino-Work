1. Two buttons to toggle on and off the functionality of the bot. How to set up?

2. A red and green LED light. The green LED turns on when the bot is on. The red LED turns on
   when the collision sensor module detects an impact. Switch 5V to PWM wiring?

*4. When the bot is on, the two DC motors controlling the rear wheels will rotate forwards.

5. When a collision has been detected, three things will happen:
	- The two DC motors will turn off.
	- The red LED will turn on.
	- The active buzzer will turn on.

6. A GY-521 module will be actively monitoring acceleration and angle at all times. What use?

7. An HC-501 module will be monitoring distance in front of the bot at all times. What use?

8. A 9V battery will be mounted in the back and will provide power to the Arduino MEGA and 
   the power supply module. How to provide power to the Power Supply Module?
